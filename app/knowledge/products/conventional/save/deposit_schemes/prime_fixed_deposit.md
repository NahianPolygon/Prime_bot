## Loan Facility Against FD

### Borrowing Against Fixed Deposit

- **Maximum Loan:** 90% of FD amount
- **Interest Rate:** Bank's prevailing loan rate
- **Approval:** Quick (2-3 days)
- **Tenure:** Flexible terms

### How It Works

1. Request loan against your FD
2. Bank calculates 90% of FD amount
3. Loan approved and disbursed
4. FD remains active and earns interest
5. Loan repaid by FD maturity
6. Remaining balance after loan paid to you

### Example

**FD Details:**
- Amount: BDT 10,00,000
- Tenor: 12 months
- After 6 months: Need loan

**Loan Available:**
- Maximum: 90% of BDT 10,00,000 = BDT 9,00,000
- Can borrow up to BDT 9,00,000
- FD continues earning interest
- At maturity: Loan paid from FD, balance to you

---

## Auto-Renewal Option

### Two Renewal Choices

**Option 1: With Interest Auto-Renewal**
- At maturity: Principal + Interest = New FD amount
- Continues earning interest
- More wealth accumulation
- Automatic compounding

**Option 2: Without Interest Auto-Renewal**
- At maturity: Only principal renewed
- Interest credited to linked account
- Interest amount taken out
- Principal keeps rotating

### Example: With Interest Renewal

**Year 1:**
- Deposit: BDT 10,00,000 @ 8%
- Maturity: BDT 10,80,000 (principal + interest)

**Year 2 (Auto-Renewed):**
- New FD: BDT 10,80,000 @ 8%
- Maturity: BDT 11,66,400

**Year 3 (Auto-Renewed):**
- New FD: BDT 11,66,400 @ 8%
- Maturity: BDT 12,59,712

**Result:** In 3 years without touching money = BDT 12.6 lac (26% growth from compound interest)
