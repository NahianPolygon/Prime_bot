## Pre-Maturity Encashment Rules

### Important: Interest Forfeiture

**Scheme closed before 1 Year:**
- **NO interest will be paid**
- You receive only principal amount
- Complete loss of earned interest

**Scheme closed after 1 Year but before Maturity:**
- **Interest at 2% LESS than booked rate**
- Example: 9% rate becomes 7% on early withdrawal
- Interest calculated for completed period only

### Example: Early Encashment Scenario

**Situation:**
- Tenor: 5 years @ 9%
- Monthly: BDT 50,000
- Closed after: 2 years (24 months)

**Calculation:**
- Total deposited: BDT 50,000 × 24 = BDT 12,00,000
- Interest rate applied: 9% - 2% = 7%
- Interest earned: BDT 12,00,000 × 7% × (2/5 years) = ~BDT 84,000
- Amount received: BDT 12,00,000 + BDT 84,000 = BDT 12,84,000
