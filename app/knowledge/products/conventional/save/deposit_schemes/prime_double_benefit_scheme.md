## Doubling Calculation

### Interest Rate & Tenure

- **Interest Rate:** 9.25% per annum (fixed)
- **Tenure:** 7 years 11 months (95 months)
- **Doubling Effect:** Principal + 100% interest = 2x original amount

### Mathematical Breakdown

Using compound interest formula:
- Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^Time
- Amount = P × (1.0925)^(7.92)
- Result = Approximately 2P (doubles)

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Minimum Deposit**
- Deposit: BDT 10,000
- Maturity: BDT 20,000
- Time: 7 years 11 months
- Gain: BDT 10,000

**Example 2: Small Saver**
- Deposit: BDT 1,00,000
- Maturity: BDT 2,00,000
