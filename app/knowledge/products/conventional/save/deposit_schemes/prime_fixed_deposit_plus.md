## Auto-Renewal Options Explained

### Option 1: Auto-Renewal With Interest

- Continues earning interest
- Automatic compounding
- More wealth accumulation

**Example:**
- FD1 (91 days): BDT 1,00,000 → BDT 1,02,434
- Auto-renewed as FD2: BDT 1,02,434 earns interest again
- FD2 (91 days): BDT 1,02,434 → BDT 1,04,914
- Compound growth: ~2.5% in 6 months

**Best for:** Long-term wealth building, compounding benefit seekers

### Option 2: Auto-Renewal Without Interest (Principal Only)

- Interest taken out (available for spending)
- Same principal cycles

**Example:**
- FD1 (91 days): BDT 1,00,000 → Mature to BDT 1,02,434
- Interest BDT 2,434 credited to account (you receive)
- Principal BDT 1,00,000 renewed as FD2
- Continuous BDT 2,434 every 91 days (income stream)

**Best for:** Regular income seekers, living off interest, quarterly cash flow needs
