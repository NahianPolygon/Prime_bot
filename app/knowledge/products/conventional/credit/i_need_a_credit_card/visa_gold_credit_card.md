## 50-Day Interest-Free Period Explained

### How It Works

**Timeline Example:**

| Date | Event | Days Remaining |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Jan 5** | Purchase made | 50 days |
| **Jan 20** | Statement generated | 35 days |
| **Feb 1** | Payment due | 24 days |
| **Feb 25** | Last interest-free date | 0 days |

**Key Points:**
- Grace period starts from statement generation, not purchase date
- Full outstanding balance covered
- Pay in full = Zero interest
- Partial payment = Interest on remaining amount

### Interest-Free Shopping Strategy

**Optimal Usage:**

1. **Make Purchase:** Early in statement cycle (Day 1-10)
2. **Receive Statement:** 20 days later
3. **Interest-Free Window:** Next 50 days available
4. **Plan Payment:** Schedule before day 50
5. **Pay Full:** Avoid interest completely

**Example:**
- Purchase BDT 1,00,000 on Jan 5
- Statement Jan 20
- Due Feb 9
- Interest-free until Feb 25 (50 days)
- **Total grace period:** 50+ days!
