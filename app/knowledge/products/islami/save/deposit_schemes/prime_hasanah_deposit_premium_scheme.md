## Maturity Value Calculation

**Formula for custom amounts:**

If monthly installment is not in table:
- Find the closest base amount (e.g., 500)
- Get maturity value from table
- Multiply by your multiplier

**Example:**
- Monthly: BDT 2,500 for 5 years
- 2,500 ÷ 500 = 5 multiplier
- 5-year BDT 500 maturity: 37,925
- 37,925 × 5 = **BDT 1,89,625**
